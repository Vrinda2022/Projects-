# Token Project- (Metacrafter Projects Assessment)

Learn the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology, including decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic principles.

## Description

Develop and deploy a simple token on a blockchain platform, such as creating an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. This involves writing a smart contract that defines the tokenâ€™s behavior, supply, and other properties. Understand how tokens are transferred between addresses, including the underlying mechanisms of token transactions on the blockchain. Learn to interact with the blockchain using tools like web3.js, ethers.js, or Truffle, enabling activities such as token transfers, balance checks, and smart contract interactions.
